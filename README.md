This file contains the code for Group 7's BIOL 4559 final project. We investigated the evolution of social dominance using network visualization and two different ranking methods using Hobson and DeDeo's 2015 parakeet aggression dataset.
Data: This folder contains the parakeet aggression data frame as a txt file named aggXquarter, and its README. The data is from 
  Hobson, E. A., & DeDeo, S. (2015). Social Feedback and the Emergence of Rank in Animal Society. PLOS Computational Biology, 11(9), e1004411. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004411
Figures: This folder contains plots and other figures generated in the code and included in the final draft as png and html files.
Src: This folder contains Python code used to generate rank swirl diagrams.
MVR: This jupyter notebook contains the code to create a minimum violation ranking and associated figures, including violation matrices and rank trajectories, from the parakeet aggression dataset, including the necessary data wrangling.
SpringRank: This jupyter notebook contains the code to create a spring ranking and associated figures, including rank swirl plots and rank trajectories, from the parakeet aggression dataset, including the necessary data wrangling. Network visualizations are also included in this notebook.
